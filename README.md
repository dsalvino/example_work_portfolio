# example_work_portfolio
This is a Homework portfolio for Unit 2 of bootcampspot. This stumped my smooth brain, I was not able to properly utilize flexbox and box models.

#Installation
It's only an HTML with a reset.css and a subpar styling sheet. Clone it, but maybe later when I'm proud of it.

#Acknowledgements
At the end of the night I ended up looking at a colleagues .css to see what they did and honestly... I hate myself, but I will be going their route (grids) to simplify things for myself.

#Did I Cry at any point working on this project?
yes
